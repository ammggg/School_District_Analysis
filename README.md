School District Analysis
------------------------

Overview
--------
The purpose of this analysis was to examine possible academic dishonesty at Thomas High School, specifically as it relates to reading and math scores for their 9th graders. 

Results
-------
Given that the only data that was changed pertained to the Thomas High School 9th graders, none of the data for the other schools was affected. On an overall basis, and quite surprisngly, there was no change to the summary data once we removed the Thomas High School 9th grade reading and math scores.

When taking a look at a summary broken out by school, Thomas High School's overall passing percentage showed a slight decrease when we removed the 9th grade scores; from 90.9% in the original analysis to 90.6% in the refactored analysis. 

Summary
-------
Based on this analysis, it does not seem that by removing the 9th grade reading and math grades from Thomas High School's dataset has any discernable affect on their overall test scores. When breaking down the data granularly, whether it be by grade, school spending, school size, or school type, the data that we see if the refactored code does not differ significantly from what we see in the original analysis. This could be due to the fact that 9th graders at Thomas High School represent a smaller proportion of total test scores and are actually in line with what is seen in 10th through 12th graders, so removing them did not move the averages up or down. It could also mean that if there is academic dishonesty, it may reside in other grade levels.
